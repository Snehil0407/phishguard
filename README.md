## Project Overview

PhishGuard is a comprehensive phishing detection and user awareness platform that identifies phishing attempts across **emails, SMS messages, and URLs**. Built as a MCA 6th Trimester Major Project, it combines a web application with a browser extension, both powered by an AI-driven backend.

## Features

- 🔍 **Multi-Input Detection**: Analyze emails, SMS, and URLs
- 🤖 **AI-Powered**: Machine learning models with NLP
- 📊 **Explainable Results**: Clear risk scores with explanations
- ⚡ **Real-Time Protection**: Browser extension for instant URL scanning
- 📚 **User Education**: Awareness content and safety tips

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- FastAPI
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas & NumPy

### Frontend
- React.js
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios

### Extension
- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- JavaScript

### Database & Auth
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Authentication
